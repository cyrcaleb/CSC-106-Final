# Asteroid Game Project
This was a project that was started off for me and my class partner's first computer science class
Unfortunately the project was cancelled so it did not need to be completed but we still chose to finish it because we thought it was a fun project and we were both interested in learning about the SCRUM process.
It was made using Kahn's version of Javascript and the biggest things we took out of this project were the SCRUM process, collaboration, breaking up problems into doable stages with timeframes, and how to use Github requests and commits along with branches.
